# Building-with-Arc-USDC-Native-ERC-20-Integration-
A developer-focused demo showing how to integrate Arc’s USDC token with both native and ERC-20 interfaces. This project demonstrates reading balances, sending transfers, handling decimal conversions, and building dapps that fully leverage Arc’s dual-interface USDC while following best practices for reliability and EVM compatibility.
